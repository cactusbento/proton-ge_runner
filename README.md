# Simple Proton Runner.

A binary executable that serves as a simple alternative to the runner script from [proton-ge's aur package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-ge-custom-bin).

It essentially runs `.exe`s with `proton run <.exe name here>`

## Why?

Because I didn't want to deal with changing the default run mode of the script every time [proton-ge](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-ge-custom-bin) updates.
